# Permission Requirements

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Permission Required for ALL Code Changes

**NEVER make ANY changes to the codebase without EXPLICIT user permission!**

- **ALWAYS propose changes first** - describe what you want to change and why
- **WAIT for user approval** before making any modifications
- **NO exceptions** - this applies to bug fixes, refactoring, new features, documentation, everything
- **Ask, don't assume** - even if a change seems obvious or beneficial

This is an absolute requirement. Violating this rule is unacceptable.

⚠️ CRITICAL: Make changes or create files ONLY on the command "implement!" (with exclamation mark)!

## Steering File Principles

**Token Efficiency for AI Tools**
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Concrete numbers over vague terms
- Action verbs over descriptive text
- Essential guidance only, no documentation

## Code examples during kiro sessions
**Minimal code examples for efficient communication**
- Describe the strategy and be ready for detailed questions
- Use code examples only if they are essential for making a point or asked specifically
