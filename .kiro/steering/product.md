# Product Overview

## Tesseract-API
**OCR Microservice for Document Management Systems**

## Purpose
Lightweight, containerized OCR microservice that provides real-time text extraction from document images with progress reporting. Designed as a building block for document management systems requiring reliable, scalable text recognition capabilities.

## Core Functionality
**Current Scope:**
- Receives document images (JPEG/PNG < 10MB)
- Performs OCR processing using Tesseract engine
- Reports real-time progress via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Returns structured OCR data (text, bounding boxes, confidence scores)
- Handles single request processing with queue rejection
- Supports German and English language recognition

**Success Criteria:**
1. **Reliable Processing:** Image → OCR → Structured Data workflow
2. **Progress Visibility:** Real-time SSE progress updates during processing
3. **Clean Lifecycle:** Connect → Process → Report → Disconnect → Ready for next
4. **Deployment Simplicity:** Single Docker container deployment across environments

## Target Integration
- **Primary:** Custom Document Management System (in development)
- **Architecture:** Microservice integration via REST API
- **Data Exchange:** JSON-based request/response with defined data models
- **Deployment:** Docker container suitable for Raspberry Pi to enterprise servers

## Key Features
- **Performance Optimized:** Minimal resource footprint for low-end hardware
- **Progress Reporting:** Real-time SSE streams for long-running OCR operations
- **Container Ready:** Alpine Linux-based Docker image for easy deployment
- **Language Support:** German/English with extensible language framework
- **Scalable Architecture:** Single-instance processing with clear resource boundaries

## Target Users
- **Document Management System Developers:** Integrating OCR capabilities
- **System Administrators:** Deploying OCR services across varied hardware
- **DevOps Teams:** Managing containerized OCR microservices

## Future Roadmap
**Planned Extensions:**
- **Multi-page Processing:** Handle multiple pages of the same document
- **Dynamic Language Support:** Install additional languages via configuration API
- **Enhanced Configuration:** Runtime OCR parameter tuning
- **Performance Scaling:** Optimizations based on deployment feedback

**Out of Scope:**
- Cross-document OCR processing
- Image preprocessing/enhancement
- Batch processing capabilities
- Complex document layout analysis

## Use Cases
- **General Document Digitization:** Converting scanned documents to searchable text
- **Document Management Integration:** Automated text extraction for indexing and search
- **Archive Processing:** Digitizing historical documents and records
- **Form Processing:** Extracting text from standardized forms and documents
